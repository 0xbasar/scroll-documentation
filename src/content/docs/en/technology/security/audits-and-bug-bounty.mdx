Scroll treats security as a top priority.

Aside from rigorous testing, an internal security team, and comprehensive code reviews, we have also engaged with multiple security audit firms to conduct audits on our codebase. We have also launched a bug bounty program to encourage the community to participate in the security of our protocol.

<Aside type="danger" title="">
  Audits don't guarantee the absence of security vulnerabilities. Using blockchains comes with risk, and Scroll is no
  exception. We encourage users to use the protocol with caution and at their own risk.

## Independent Audits

Scroll has worked with several industry-leading security audit firms to review our codebase, with critical code receiving reviews from multiple teams, including [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/), [Zellic](https://www.zellic.io/), [KALOS](https://www.kalos.xyz/), and [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/).

- Trail of Bits, Zellic, and KALOS have reviewed our zkEVM circuits
- OpenZeppelin and Zellic have performed independent audits on our bridge & rollup contracts
- Trail of Bits has analyzed our node implementation

<Aside type="tip" title="">
  We're still working with partners to get all of our reports published. We'll update this page with links as they
  become available.

## Bug Bounty Program

Scroll has an active [Bug Bounty Program on Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/scroll/), a leading bug bounty platform. The program is open to the public, and we encourage anyone to participate.

Rewards depend on the severity of reported vulnerabilities:

- **Critical**: up to \$1,000,00
- **High**: \$10,000 - \$50,000
- **Medium**: \$5,000

### Scope

The scope of the bug bounty program covers the blockchain infrastructure and the smart contracts for bridging and rollup. For a detailed breakdown of bug categories, please refer to the bug bounty page.

Besides the listed scopes in the bug bounty program, we also encourage security reviews on our [zkEVM circuits](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits). For any discoveries, please kindly send your reports to security@scroll.io.
